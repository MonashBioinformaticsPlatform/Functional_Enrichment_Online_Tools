# Overview

## Functional analysis of -Omics data 

### General information

The workshop covers the bioinformatics concepts and tools available for interpreting a gene list using gene ontology and pathway information. The workshop focuses on the principles and concepts required for analysing and conducting functional and pathway analysis on a gene list from any organism, although the focus will be on human and model eukaryotic organisms.

### Course Objectives

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

- Understand basic concepts of functional enrichment analysis;
- Interpret enrichment analysis results;
- Get systems perspective of gene functions;
- Get more information about a gene list;
- Discover what pathways are enriched in a gene list (and use it for hypothesis generation);
- Predict gene function and extend a gene list;
- Follow workflow after the workshop to conduct their own analysis.

### Target Audience

This workshop is intended for biologists working with ‘-Omics data’ (e.g. RNA-Seq, protein expression), who are interested in interpreting large gene/protein lists resulting from their experiments.

### Setup Requirements

This workshop will be delivered in-person. It is recommended to install the [GSEA](https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/) and [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) software.

Links and material are provided on `resources` page.

BYO coffee :)
