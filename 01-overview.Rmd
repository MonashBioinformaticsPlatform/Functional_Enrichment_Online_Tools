# Overview

## Functional Analysis of -Omics Data

### General Information

The workshop covers the bioinformatics concepts and tools for interpreting a gene list using Gene Ontology and pathway information. The workshop focuses on the principles and concepts required for analysing and conducting functional and pathway analyses on a gene list from any organism, although the focus will be on human and model eukaryotic organisms.

### Course Objectives

Participants will gain practical experience and skills to be able to:

-   Understand basic concepts of functional enrichment analysis;
-   Interpret enrichment analysis results;
-   Gain systems perspective of gene functions;
-   Obtain more information about a gene list;
-   Discover which pathways are enriched in a gene list (and use this information for hypothesis generation);
-   Predict gene function and extend a gene list;
-   Follow the workflow after the workshop to conduct their own analyses.

### Target Audience

This workshop is intended for biologists working with ‘-Omics data’ (e.g., RNA-seq, protein expression), who are interested in interpreting large gene/protein lists resulting from their experiments.

### Setup Requirements

The workshop will be held **in person**. Participants are encouraged to bring a **laptop**; however, **no software installation is necessary**.  

Workshop materials and relevant links can be found on the [**Resources**](https://monashbioinformaticsplatform.github.io/Functional_Enrichment_Online_Tools/resources.html) page.


BYO coffee :)
