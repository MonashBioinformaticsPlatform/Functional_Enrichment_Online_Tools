# Example Analysis


## SH-SY5Y Differentiation

SH-SY5Y is a commonly used neuroblastoma cell line. 
With appropriate treatment, it can be induced to differentiate into a ‘more neuronal’ form. 
Differentiated cells look quite different, growing thin neurites out from the body of the cell.

## The Question: What Pathways Are Involved in SH-SY5Y Differentiation?

In their paper [_Transcriptomic Profiling Discloses Molecular and Cellular Events Related to Neuronal Differentiation in SH-SY5Y Neuroblastoma Cells_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10571-016-0403-y), Pezzini et al. induced neuronal differentiation of the SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line and measured transcriptomic changes using RNA sequencing (Pezzini et al. 2017). During the 9-day differentiation protocol, SH-SY5Y cells were initially pre-differentiated in a retinoic acid (RA) medium for 6 days, followed by a 3-day treatment with a neurobasal medium (NBM) enriched with neurotrophic factors. Control cells, which were not treated (NT), were maintained under basal conditions and served as a comparison group. The authors then performed functional enrichment analysis on the differentially expressed genes.

## The data : Differentially Expressed Genes

The example dataset for today is the RNA-seq differential expression results.  

They can be accessed via this [Degust](http://degust.erc.monash.edu/degust/compare.html?code=5b2c7805ab8f8c5f2dc8c72e61b049b0#?plot=mds) link: 

This dataset has been re-analysed from the published raw data using the Degust tool. 


> **Note:** Other tools and approaches may produce slightly different-looking results, but generally you will end up with a table of genes containing some measure of statistical confidence. The methods for functional enrichment analysis should remain similar.
